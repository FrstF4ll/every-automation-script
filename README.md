# The renamer

Script that automatically rename following rules. Could be used as a template to later easily customize it.

# The mass-mover
Script that move certain files with certain prefix, suffix, or under other conditions to a folder i set up, without having to write everytime "mv * /my/path/to/that/long/folder".

# The Prefix creator
Generate prefix for each files in a folder

# ... and More
I'm open to suggestions and would happily try my best to build these, either for fun, or for real utility. 

This is more of a "learning" projects (made of "other project" in a certain way). 

I'm open to your suggestions.
