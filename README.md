# Script ideas
Nothing has been build since today, it's more about... Ideas, and suggestion, so i can be driven on some small projects. 
One i already made is a basic "calculator" that automatically apply Viet's Formula for my Math course, if you people ask, i'd happily share the source code, as it is... Tbh really simple.
### The renamer

Script that automatically rename following rules. Could be used as a template to later easily customize it.

### The mass-mover
Script that move certain files with certain prefix, suffix, or under other conditions to a folder i set up, without having to write everytime "mv * /my/path/to/that/long/folder".

### The Prefix creator
Generate prefix for each files in a folder

### ... and More
I'm open to suggestions and would happily try my best to build these, either for fun, or for real utility. 

This is more of a "learning" projects (made of "other project" in a certain way). 

I'm open to your suggestions.
